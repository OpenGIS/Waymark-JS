# Documentation

Waymark JS is a JavaScript library for creating and sharing geographical information. It is designed to be easy to use and intuitive, and is suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use Waymark JS, you will need to include the following assets your document. Here we are adding them to the `<head>` of the document so they are immediately available to the `<body>`:

```html
<!-- jQuery (required) -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js"></script>

<!-- Waymark CSS & JavaScript -->

<!-- TODO: confirm URLS  -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/css/waymark-js.min.css" />
<script src="dist/js/waymark-js.min.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, the `<script>` tags could be placed at the end of the `<body>` to defer loading.

> [!TIP]
> Waymark JS requires the `jQuery` global to be available before creating a Map. If you are not already using jQuery, you can include it from a CDN as shown above.

### Usage

To display a Map, place an empty `<div>` in the body of your document. If you plan to display just one Map on the page, you can use the default `id` of `waymark-map`.

```html
<!-- Map Container -->
<div id="waymark-map"></div>
```

> [!TIP]
> For multiple Maps, provide the unique `id` for each using the `map_options.map_div_id` option.

To initialise the Map, we need to add a `<script>` tag to the document. This should be placed _after_ the Map Container, jQuery and Waymark JS assets have been included.

```html
<!-- Map Initialisation -->
<script>
  // Create a Viewer Instance
  const viewer = window.Waymark_Map_Factory.viewer();

  // Initialise with our options
  viewer.init({
    map_options: {
      // Initial Map Zoom
      map_init_zoom: 16,

      // Define a new Type
      marker_types: [
        {
          // The title is used to create the "pub" Type Key
          marker_title: "Pub",
          marker_icon: "ion-beer",
          marker_colour: "brown",
        },
      ],
    },
  });

  // Load a Marker from GeoJSON
  viewer.load_json({
    type: "FeatureCollection",
    features: [
      {
        type: "Feature",
        properties: {
          // The "pub" Type Key
          type: "pub",
          title: "The Scarlet Ibis",
          description:
            "Great pub, great food! Especially after a Long Ride üö¥üçîüçüüç∫üç∫üí§",
          image_large_url: "https://www.waymark.dev/assets/geo/pub.jpeg",
        },
        geometry: {
          type: "Point",
          coordinates: [-128.0094, 50.6539],
        },
      },
    ],
  });
</script>
```

The above example creates a Viewer Instance and initialises it with a custom Marker Type, defined in the `map_options` object. The Marker location is loaded from GeoJSON and because the feature has a `type` property of `pub`, it is displayed using the custom Type.

> [!TIP]
> Each Type has a unique Key that is used to identify it (e.g. `pub` in the above example). This is created from the `marker_title` property, so Type Titles should be unique.

## Modes

Maps can either be read-only using the Viewer, or editable using the Editor. Both the Viewer and Editor extend the `Waymark_Map` class.

<!-- TODO: Add more detail -->

## Instances

Multiple maps can be used on a single page, each with their own configuration. A single Map is known as an Instance and is created using the `Waymark_Map_Factory` which is attached to the `window` object.

For example, to create a new (read-only) Instance:

```javascript
// This Waymark_Map_Viewer Instance extends Waymark_Map class
const waymark_viewer = window.Waymark_Map_Factory.viewer();
```
