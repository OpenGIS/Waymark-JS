# Displaying Geographical Data

Waymark JS builds on top of the [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) standard to represent map data. It uses the standard structure for geometry and leverages the `properties` object to link features to styles defined in your [Configuration](3.config.md).

Data is loaded into an instance using the `loadGeoJSON` method.

# FeatureCollection

The root object is a standard GeoJSON `FeatureCollection`.

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "properties": {},
  "features": []
}
```

## properties

> [!NOTE]
> In future versions, Waymark JS will use the root `properties` object to store map-level metadata, such as the initial center and zoom level.

## features

The `features` array contains the individual map elements. Each feature links to a specific style configuration.

### properties

The `properties` object contains metadata and the critical `type` field.

#### type

The `type` property links the feature to a specific definition in your configuration.

- **Markers**: Links to a [Marker Type](3.config.md#marker-types) (e.g., `pub`).
- **Lines**: Links to a [Line Type](3.config.md#line-types) (e.g., `footpath`).
- **Shapes**: Links to a [Shape Type](3.config.md#shape-types) (e.g., `park`).

The value must match the [Type Key](3.config.md#type-keys) generated from the title in your config (lowercase, alphanumeric only).

**Example:**

If your config defines a Marker Type with the title "Pub":

```javascript
// Config
marker_types: [{ marker_title: "Pub", ... }]
```

Your GeoJSON feature references it like this:

```json
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [...]
  },
  "properties": {
    "type": "pub",
    "title": "The Red Lion"
  }
}
```
