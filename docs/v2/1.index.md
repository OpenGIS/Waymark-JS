Create, Edit and Share Meaningful Maps

Waymark JS is a JavaScript library for creating and sharing geographical information. It is designed to be easy to use and intuitive, and is suitable for a wide range of applications due to its flexibility and customisation [options](/docs/v2/2.instances.md#map-options). Waymark JS stores data in GeoJSON format.

Built on the shoulders of giants:

- [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/) for map rendering
- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) for map data
- [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/) for vector tiles

## Quick Start

Display a Map with a custom Marker.

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://unpkg.com/@ogis/waymark-js/dist/waymark-js.css"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="waymark-instance" style="height: 480px"></div>

    <script type="module">
      import { Instance } from "https://unpkg.com/@ogis/waymark-js/dist/waymark-js.js";

      // Create a Waymark Instance with this configuration
      const instance = new Instance({
        // [Map Options](docs/v2/2.instances.md#map-options)
        map_options: {
          // [MapLibre MapOptions](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/API/type-aliases/MapOptions/)
          maplibre_options: {
            zoom: 12,
          },

          // [Marker Types](docs/v2/2.instances.md#marker-types)
          marker_types: [
            {
              // The Title is used to create the "pub" Type Key
              marker_title: "Pub",
              marker_icon: "ion-beer",
              marker_colour: "brown",
            },
          ],
        },
      });

      // Load this GeoJSON, which contains a single "pub" Marker
      instance.loadGeoJSON({
        type: "FeatureCollection",
        features: [
          {
            type: "Feature",
            properties: {
              type: "pub",
              title: "The Scarlet Ibis",
              description:
                "Great pub, great food! Especially after a Long Ride üö¥üçîüçüüç∫üç∫üí§",
              image_large_url: "https://www.waymark.dev/assets/geo/pub.jpeg",
            },
            geometry: {
              type: "Point",
              coordinates: [-128.0094, 50.6539],
            },
          },
        ],
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Installation

Waymark JS can be installed via npm (for use in a build system) or via a CDN (for direct use in the browser).

### NPM

To install Waymark JS via npm, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @ogis/waymark-js
```

You can then import the library and its stylesheet into your JavaScript file:

```javascript
import { Instance } from "@ogis/waymark-js";
import "@ogis/waymark-js/dist/waymark-js.css";
```

### CDN

To use Waymark JS, you will need to include the following assets in your page. Here we are adding the Stylesheet in the `<head>`, and the JavaScript just before the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
<head>
  <!-- Waymark JS Stylesheet -->
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://unpkg.com/@ogis/waymark-js/dist/waymark-js.css"
  />
</head>

<body>
  <!-- Waymark JS Script -->
  <script type="module">
    import { Instance } from "https://unpkg.com/@ogis/waymark-js/dist/waymark-js.js";
  </script>
</body>
```

### HTML

We also add an empty `<div>` with a unique ID attribute, which will be used as the Instance container. If you plan to display just one Instance on the page, you can use the default `id` of `waymark-instance`.

```html
<!-- Instance Container (with a defined height) -->
<div id="waymark-instance" style="height: 480px"></div>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The element that contains the Instance must have a **height** set, either inline or via CSS.

## Usage

Once you have included the required assets, you can create a Waymark Instance using the `Instance` class.
You can pass configuration options to the constructor, including [map options](/docs/v2/2.instances.md#map-options) and [marker types](/docs/v2/2.instances.md#marker-types).

```javascript
import { Instance } from "https://unpkg.com/@ogis/waymark-js/dist/waymark-js.js";

// Create a Waymark Instance with this configuration
const instance = new Instance({
  map_options: {
    // Here we are adjusting the zoom
    maplibre_options: {
      zoom: 12,
    },

    // Here we are defining a custom Marker Type
    marker_types: [
      {
        // The Title is used to create the "pub" Type Key
        marker_title: "Pub",
        marker_icon: "ion-beer",
        marker_colour: "brown",
      },
    ],
  },
});

// Load this GeoJSON, which contains a single "pub" Marker
instance.loadGeoJSON({
  type: "FeatureCollection",
  features: [
    {
      type: "Feature",
      properties: {
        type: "pub",
        title: "The Scarlet Ibis",
        description:
          "Great pub, great food! Especially after a Long Ride üö¥üçîüçüüç∫üç∫üí§",
        image_large_url: "https://www.waymark.dev/assets/geo/pub.jpeg",
      },
      geometry: {
        type: "Point",
        coordinates: [-128.0094, 50.6539],
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

The above example creates a Viewer Instance and initialises it with a custom Marker Type, defined in the `map_options` [object](map#map-options). The Marker location is loaded from GeoJSON and because the feature has a `type` property of `pub`, it is displayed using the custom Type.

> [!TIP]
> Each Type has a unique Key that is used to identify it (e.g. `pub` in the above example). This is created from the `marker_title` property, so Type Titles should be unique.
